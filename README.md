## üß© System Entities Explained

### 1. Employer
Imagine an employer as a company or organization looking to hire new talent. In our system:
- An employer can post multiple job listings
- Each employer has a unique identifier and name
- Example: "TechInnovate Solutions" might be an employer posting jobs for software developers

### 2. Job
Jobs are the heart of our recruitment platform:
- Represents a specific job opening
- Must be associated with one or more job fields (like "Software Development" or "Marketing")
- Must specify one or more provinces/regions where the job is available
- Example: A "Senior Java Developer" position in Ho Chi Minh City

### 3. Seeker
Job seekers are professionals looking for new opportunities:
- Can create multiple resumes
- Associated with a specific province where they're searching for work
- Example: A software engineer looking for jobs in Hanoi

### 4. Resume
A resume is a professional's calling card:
- Created by a single seeker
- Can be linked to multiple job fields
- Can target multiple provinces
- Example: A comprehensive CV highlighting a developer's skills and experience

### 5. Job Field
Think of job fields as professional categories:
- Pre-populated with existing data
- Provides a standardized way to categorize jobs and resumes
- Examples: "Software Engineering", "Marketing", "Sales"

### 6. Job Province
Represents geographical regions:
- Pre-populated with existing data
- Helps in localizing job searches
- Examples: "Ho Chi Minh City", "Hanoi", "Da Nang"
